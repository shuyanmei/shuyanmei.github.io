      <description>Introduction
Tech industry has been booming for years. We hear a lot of stories of peaks such as competitive salaries, work-life balance, unlimited vacation one can get working in a tech company. But are the employees really happy with their jobs? What drives their satisfaction and what makes them to leave?
I used data from Stackoverflow&amp;rsquo;s 2017 Annual Developer Survey to investigate this problem.
This survey has around 64000 reviews from 213 countries.</description>

      <description>An order book is an electronic list of buy and sells orders for a specific security or financial instrument, organized by price level. The order book lists the number of shares being bid or offered at each price point. A dynamic order book is constantly updated in real time based on orders received from market participants such as banks, proprietary trading firms and retail investors.
Here I am trying to show how to create a dynamic order book with Python.</description>

      <description>Hello, I finally got my first personal webpage set up!
I will use this website to share some of my projects in statistics, machine learning or programming.
This website is hosted on Github and I used Hugo and Ananke to set up.</description>
