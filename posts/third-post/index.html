<p>Tech industry has been booming for years. We hear a lot of stories of peaks such as competitive salaries, work-life balance, unlimited vacation one can get working in a tech company.  But are the employees really happy with their jobs? What drives their satisfaction and what makes them to leave?</p>

<p>I used data from Stackoverflow&rsquo;s 2017 Annual Developer Survey to investigate this problem.</p>

<p>This survey has around 64000 reviews from 213 countries. The survey&rsquo;s responses are mostly collected from developers and the questions asked in the survey are related to many aspects of developer&rsquo;s job and career. Some of the aspects covered:</p>

<p>1) How do they break into this field at the first place?<br />
2) The developer&rsquo;s education, especially coding background<br />
3) The developers&rsquo; job responsibility and satisfaction<br />
4) What makes them to looking for new opportunity? What they value most when they look for the next position?<br />
5) The developers&rsquo; interaction with Stackoverflow.</p>

<p>Here I am interested in dig dive into data to figure out three problems.</p>

<p><strong>Part I How satisfied are you as a developer ?</strong><br />
There is one rating question in the survey asking about the job satisfaction. The answer is rated from 0-10 which 10 represents highly satisfied and 0 represents highly dissatisfied. I first filter out responses with NA values. Below is a table showing the response counts and percentage for each rating.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Job Satisfaction</th>
<th align="center">Rating Counts</th>
<th align="center">Percentage</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>

<td align="center">8.0</td>

<td align="center">373</td>
<td align="center">0.92%</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Here, I used a metric called &lsquo;top 3 box&rsquo; to measure satisfaction. A Top 3 Box score summarizes the positive responses from a scale survey question. It combines the highest 3 responses of the scale to create one single number.</p>

<p>Below plot shows the job satisfaction by country using the metric top 3 box. The countries I selected here have a response threshold of 500.<br />
<img src="../../JSbyCty.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Top countries for satisfaction score are Netherlands, Canada,  Sweden and United States. All these four countries has over 50% top 3 box score.</p>

<p>**Part II Does salary drive satisfaction? Is there anything else? **<br />
There are many factors which can drive job satisfaction, such as salary, health benefits and vacation. To figure out does salary drives job satisfaction. I check the average salary of the top five countries which has the highest average salary.</p>

<p>Below tables shows the average salary of these countries.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Country</th>
<th align="center">Average Salary</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">United States</td>
<td align="center">86862.40</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Canada</td>
<td align="center">60821.54</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">United Kingdom</td>
<td align="center">56086.99</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">Germany</td>
<td align="center">44121.32</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center">India</td>
<td align="center">11603.47</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The top countries with high average salaries also have a high job satisfaction (except India). Salary does have some impact on the job satisfaction. In addition to salary, does the benefits also influence employees&rsquo;s satisfaction?</p>

<p>One of the survey&rsquo;s question is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When it comes to compensation and benefits, other than base salary, which of the following are most important to you?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following table shows the counts of each factors people think is most important to them.</p>

<tr>
<td align="center">None of these</td>
<td align="center">82</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The top three factosr are vacation, health benefits and expected work hours.</p>

<p><strong>Part III Why people leaved their job?</strong><br />
To figure out why people are leaving their job, I took a closer look at below question in the survey.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*You said before that you used to code as part of your job, but no longer do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? *</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top three reasons for people to quit coding are:</p>

<p>1) I don&rsquo;t think my coding skills are up to date<br />
2) If money weren&rsquo;t an issue, I would take a coding job again<br />
3) My career is going the way I thought it would 10 years ago</p>

<p>and they counts for 17%, 17% and 15% of the total respectively.</p>

<p>The technical skills is the most essential for developer. One need to keep updated for their coding skills. Just as important as coding skills, money also factors into developer&rsquo;s career decision. At the same time, some of the developers are looking for a career change and they do want to try out different things. That is also one reason they left their job.</p>
