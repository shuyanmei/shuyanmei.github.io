      <description>Introduction
Tech industry has been booming for years. We hear a lot of stories of peaks such as competitive salaries, work-life balance, unlimited vacation one can get working in a tech company. But are the employees really happy with their jobs? What drives their satisfaction and what makes them to leave?
I used data from Stackoverflow&amp;rsquo;s 2017 Annual Developer Survey to investigate this problem.
This survey has around 64000 reviews from 213 countries.</description>
